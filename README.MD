## 2. Inter-Service Communication

Defines protocols and patterns for how services interact.

*   **A. Primary Communication Protocols:**
    *   **Internal Service-to-Service:** **gRPC** (HTTP/2, Protobuf) is recommended for performance, typed contracts, and code generation. Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous tasks and decoupling.
    *   **External Client-to-System:**
        *   IMAP Clients to IMAP Gateway: IMAP over TCP (with TLS).
        *   Admin Web UI/API Consumers to API Gateway: HTTPS (RESTful APIs with JSON).
        *   Webhook Emitters to External Systems: HTTPS (POST with JSON).

*   **B. Key Data Flows (Examples):**
    *   **User Login (IMAP):** Client -> IMAP Gateway -> AuthN/AuthZ Service -> Session Management Service.
    *   **Fetch Email Headers (IMAP):** Client -> IMAP Gateway -> Session Management Service -> Data Storage Abstraction Layer.
    *   **New Email Arrival & MCP Processing (IMAP APPEND):** Client -> IMAP Gateway -> Session Management Service -> MCP Core -> (Plugin Host Service & Plugins) -> Data Storage Abstraction Layer. Notifications via Notification Service.
    *   **Admin Adds DLP Rule (Admin UI):** Admin Browser -> API Gateway -> MCP Core (or Policy Service) -> Configuration Store.

*   **C. Service Discovery:**
    *   Essential for services to find each other.
    *   **Options:** DNS-based, Client-side Load Balancing with Service Registry (Consul, etcd, Kubernetes services).

## 5. Plugin Architecture (MCP Core)

Details the extensible mail content processing system.

*   **A. Plugin Definition & Registration:**
    *   Self-contained units with a manifest file (`name`, `version`, `entry_point`, `interface_version_supported`, `default_config`, `stages`).
    *   Discovered and validated by `Plugin Host Service`.

*   **B. Plugin Interface/API:**
    *   Contract between `MCP Core` and plugins.
    *   **gRPC recommended** for out-of-process, language-agnostic plugins.
    *   Protobuf definition examples: `ProcessingStage`, `MessageContext` (message data, metadata, plugin config), `ActionResult` (CONTINUE, MODIFY_MESSAGE, ADD_TAG, QUARANTINE, REJECT, etc.), `ProcessMessageRequest/Response`, `MailProcessorPlugin` service with `Initialize`, `ProcessMessage`, `Shutdown` RPCs.

*   **C. Data Context Passed Between Plugins:**
    *   `MessageContext` is passed and potentially modified sequentially.
    *   `custom_metadata` field for inter-plugin communication within a pipeline.
    *   Care with large data (bodies, attachments) - consider references or on-demand fetching.

*   **D. Pipeline Configuration & Execution:**
    *   Admin-defined ordered list of plugin instances, with per-instance config.
    *   Scoped pipelines (global, tenant, user, stage).
    *   `MCP Core` executes pipeline: determines applicable pipeline, loads context, iterates plugins, interprets `ActionResult`, finalizes message.

*   **E. Error Handling within the Pipeline:**
    *   `Plugin Host Service` monitors plugin crashes/timeouts.
    *   Configurable policy for plugin failure (`fail-open`, `fail-closed`, `retry`).
    *   Plugins can report errors in `ActionResult`.

*   **F. Plugin Lifecycle & Sandboxing (by Plugin Host Service):**
    *   Load, Initialize, Serve, Shutdown.
    *   Aim for hot-reloading/updating.
    *   Sandboxing for out-of-process plugins (separate processes, containerization, resource limits, SELinux/AppArmor, WASM).

        *   Webhook Subscriptions (CRUD).

    *   Example implementation: see `api_server.py` for a minimal FastAPI
        service that validates an `X-API-Key` header against a PostgreSQL
        `api_keys` table. Only keys marked as `active` are accepted.

*   **B. Admin Web UI (SPA via Admin Web UI Service):**
    *   RBAC-driven visibility/accessibility.
    *   **Key Sections/Dashboards:**
        *   Overview (system health, key metrics, alerts).
        *   User Management.
        *   Tenant Management.
        *   Mail Processing Configuration (Plugin Management, Pipeline Editor).
        *   Policy Editor.

## 8. Migration Strategy Considerations

Toolkit for importing data from existing IMAP servers.

*   **A. Core Migration Toolkit Components:**
    *   **Migration Orchestration Service:** Manages migration tasks (API for init, monitor, control).
    *   **IMAP Connector(s):** Connects to source IMAP servers (Dovecot, Cyrus, Exchange, Gmail).
    *   **MCP Target Connector:** Uses internal APIs or privileged IMAP APPEND to import into MCP.
    *   **Migration Worker Pool:** Scalable workers for actual migration execution.
    *   **Data Mapping & Transformation Logic:** Handles folder/flag differences.

*   **B. Migration Process Workflow:**
    1.  **Configuration:** Define source, auth, user/folder mapping, options (via Admin UI/API).
    2.  **Initiation:** Orchestration service validates, queues jobs for workers.
    3.  **Initial Full Sync:** Worker connects to source, lists folders/messages, fetches, connects to MCP target, creates folders, appends messages with flags/dates, reports progress.
    4.  **Delta Sync:** Periodically syncs new/changed messages/flags (UID-based, CONDSTORE, date-based fallback) until cutover.
    5.  **Cutover:** Final delta sync, update MX/client configs, disable source.
    6.  **Post-Migration/Verification:** Verification tools, error reporting.

*   **C. Key Considerations & Challenges:**
    *   Performance & Scalability (parallel processing, batching).
    *   Rate Limiting (respect source/target limits, backoff/retry).
    *   Error Handling & Resiliency (resumable tasks, clear reporting).
    *   Data Fidelity (headers, body, flags, dates, folders).
    *   Authentication with diverse source servers (OAuth2 for Gmail/O365).
    *   Resource Consumption.
    *   User Experience (progress, estimates, logs).
    *   Security (credentials, secure transfer).
    *   Idempotency of migration operations.
    *   Potential for export functionality.

*   **D. Target Common IMAP Servers:** Dovecot, Cyrus, Exchange, Gmail, Office 365.
