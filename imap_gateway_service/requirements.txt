# This is the requirements file for the IMAP Gateway Service.
# For now, it's empty as we are only using built-in Python libraries (asyncio, logging).
# We will add dependencies here as needed (e.g., linters, testing frameworks, or other libraries).

# Example for linters (can be uncommented and installed in a virtual environment):
# flake8
# black
# mypy
